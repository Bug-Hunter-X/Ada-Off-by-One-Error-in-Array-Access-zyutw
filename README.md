This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ada programming: an off-by-one error when accessing elements of an array. Ada uses 1-based indexing, unlike some other languages that use 0-based indexing. The example code attempts to find a zero in an array, but the logic is flawed due to this indexing difference. The solution shows the corrected code with proper array access.
